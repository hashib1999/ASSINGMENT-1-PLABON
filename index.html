            <h2>Food For Familly</h2>
            <p>Incessant rains continued to pile pressure on Sylhet residents on Saturday, pushing them towards a crisis of food and drinking water.Furthermore, the last conventional means of travel to the region was closed after railway communication was suspended.</p>

        <div class="goal2 width">
            <h2>Shelter For Familly </h2>
            <p>I first heard that the city corporation has a major initiative to deal with the flood victims. But one day later, I realised that there is no such initiative. Most shelters do not get government assistance. With the exception of a few councillors like Santu Dutt, most have never visited any shelter,</p>

            <h2>Education For Familly</h2>
            <p>in order to make them educated we have some plan,For these children this is not some far-off phenomenon this is happening now. Climate vulnerable countries such as Bangladesh need more funding from the international community for adaptation as well as the loss and damage already caused by the climate emergency. Childrens homes, schools and lives are at stake</p>

            <H1>Our one step can make them happy ,and the can smile like them</H1>
            <p><small> Assalamualkum, I'm creating this  page to assist the flood victims in Bangladesh (Sylhet). To assist people in getting what they need, such as food, water, and medication, during this difficult time. We will also assist them in finding refuge and staying safe. We will also assist anyone who requires financial assistance following the flood. We will update you via video and images on how we used the money to benefit the people. Allah will reward you for every amount of money you contribute (S.W.T). Give whatever amount you desire.</small></p>
